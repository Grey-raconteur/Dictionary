# Dictionary
As the name suggests it contains the code for a dictionary that isn't case sensitive. However it comes with just a slight additional feature which is that even if you misspell your word it shows you the 10 nearest matches to chose from.

While executing both the data.json file and the code Dict.py must be in the same folder
